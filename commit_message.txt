[Cursor] i18n & UI Fixes: Accordion, Timeline, Cal.com Embed

- Refined FAQ accordion icon position and text alignment for LTR/RTL.
- Adjusted 'How We Work' timeline layout for correct RTL display (timeline on right, cards on left).
- Removed the note regarding Cal.com UI language being in English.
- Fixed Cal.com embed re-initialization issue on language switch by using dynamic script ID, dynamic Cal.com namespace, clearing the embed div, and wrapping script logic in an IIFE to prevent variable redeclaration errors.
